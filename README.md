The Movie Recommendation System is designed to enhance user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions based on individual preferences and viewing history. Using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques implemented with numpy, pandas for data handling, and sklearn for recommendation algorithms, the system analyzes user behavior to generate accurate recommendations. By considering factors such as genre preferences, movie ratings, and viewing patterns, the system ensures that users receive relevant movie suggestions that align with their interests. This project aims to improve user engagement and satisfaction on movie platforms by delivering tailored content recommendations, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and retention.
